## How to Use

First, prepare a few bitmap images:

Then run the script:

```
$ python fast_edt.py demo/*.png
Saved SDF to demo/a_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/b_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/c_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/d_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/e_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/f_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/g_sdf16.png
Saved SDF to demo/h_sdf16.png
```

Hereâ€™s what the generated SDF images look like:

Next, you can merge multiple SDF images:

```
$ python compose_multiple.py demo/*_sdf16.png
Composition done: output8.png, merged 8 images
```

Check out the result:
